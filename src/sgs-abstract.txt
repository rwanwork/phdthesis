Title:  Browsing and Searching Compressed Documents

In a phrase browsing retrieval system, the user explores a text
repository by building a phrase of interest, and then using
that phrase to locate relevant answers.  This thesis builds on an
existing off-line dictionary-based compression mechanism, and shows
how it can be employed as the basis of a phrase browsing retrieval
system.  Trade-offs between the requirements of the browsing and
the compression systems are explored, including word-based parsing,
merging of compressed blocks, efficient decoding of the reduced
message, and the design of the browsing interface.
